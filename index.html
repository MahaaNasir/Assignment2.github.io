        <h3>Protected areas and its importance </h3><br>
        <p><i><q>One touch of nature makes the whole  world kin.</q><br> ~ William Shakespeare</i></p>
        <br><br><br>

        <p1><br>
        Locations that are protected because of their acknowledged natural, ecological,
         or <br>cultural importance are known as protected areas or conservation areas.<br>
         <br>
         They are crucial for maintaining biodiversity as well as providing key ecosystem services,<br> 
         such as safeguarding watersheds, soils and protecting populated areas from natural disasters.<br>
         <br>
         There are many types of protected areas. National parks, Sanctuaries,
         Conservation <br>Reserves, and Community Reserves are
         the four types of protected areas.

         <br><br>
         To know more about the protected areas, please select one of the<br> following categories.
